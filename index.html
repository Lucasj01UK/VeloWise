          Boxing up your bikes and flying to the Alpes or renting bikes in the Dolomites in search of those perfect
          rides is easier than you think. Or why not try a coast to coast like the LEJOG (Lands end to John O'Groats).
          These cycling holiday companies specialize in making your trip a breeze. If a week away is not on the cards
          and rides are starting to become a bit stale, why not try a Micro Adventure. A short (or long) weekend is
          all you need to get away
